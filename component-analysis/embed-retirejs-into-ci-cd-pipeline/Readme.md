How to Embed RetireJS into GitLab
================================================

Use RetireJS tool to perform OAST in CI/CD pipeline
----------------------------------------------------------------

In this scenario, you will learn how to embed an SCA tool in CI/CD pipeline.

You will learn to use Retire.js in CI/CD pipeline and allow the job to fail even when the tool found several issues.

A Simple CI/CD pipeline
----------------------------------------------------------------

Considering your DevOps team created a simple CI pipeline with the following contents. Please add the Retire.js scan to this pipeline.

```
image: docker:latest

services:
  - docker:dind

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

build:
  stage: build
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env
   - source env/bin/activate
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   - python manage.py check

test:
  stage: test
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env
   - source env/bin/activate
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   - python manage.py test taskManager
```
GitLab CI/CD Machine
-------
login to gitlab account

Next, we need to create a CI/CD pipeline by replacing the .gitlab-ci.yml file content with the above CI script. Click on the Edit button to replace the content (use Control+A and Control+V).

Exercise
---------

Recall techniques you have learned in the previous module (Secure SDLC and CI/CD).

1. Explore the documentation of Retire.js tool
2. Embed OAST frontend scanning in the test stage using the Retire.js tool
3. Add another job named oast-frontend under the test stage
4. You can make use of any container image of your choice, including the node image

Embed RetireJS in CI/CD pipeline
--------------------------------

As discussed in the SCA using the Retire.js exercise, we can embed the RetireJS tool in our CI/CD pipeline. However, do remember you need to run the command manually before you embed OAST in the pipeline.

Maybe you want to scan the components before performing SAST scans.

```
image: docker:latest

services:
  - docker:dind

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

build:
  stage: build
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env
   - source env/bin/activate
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   - python manage.py check

test:
  stage: test
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env
   - source env/bin/activate
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   - python manage.py test taskManager

oast-frontend:
  stage: test
  image: node:alpine3.10
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm install -g retire # Install retirejs npm package.
    - retire --outputformat json --outputpath retirejs-report.json --severity high
  artifacts:
    paths: [retirejs-report.json]
    when: always # What is this for?
    expire_in: one week

integration:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - echo "This is an integration step."
    - exit 1
  allow_failure: true # Even if the job fails, continue to the next stages

prod:
  stage: prod
  script:
    - echo "This is a deploy step."
  when: manual # Continuous Delivery
```

Allow the job failure
----------

You do not want to fail the builds in DevSecOps Maturity Levels 1 and 2. If a security tool fails a build upon security findings, you would want to allow it to fail and not block the pipeline as there would be false positives in the results.

You can use the allow_failure tag to not fail the build even though the tool found security issues.


```
oast-frontend:
  stage: test
  image: node:alpine3.10
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm install -g retire # Install retirejs npm package.
    - retire --outputformat json --outputpath retirejs-report.json --severity high --exitwith 0
  artifacts:
    paths: [retirejs-report.json]
    when: always # What is this for?
    expire_in: one week
  allow_failure: true  #<--- allow the build to fail but don't mark it as such
```

> Notice allow_failure: true at the end of the YAML file.

The final pipeline would look like the following.

```
image: docker:20.10  # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use the latest docker image

services:
  - docker:dind       # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a docker image that contains a docker daemon running inside (dind - docker in docker). Reference: https://forum.gitlab.com/t/why-services-docker-dind-is-needed-while-already-having-image-docker/43534

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

build:
  stage: build
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env                       # Create a virtual environment for the python application
   - source env/bin/activate              # Activate the virtual environment
   - pip install -r requirements.txt      # Install the required third party packages as defined in requirements.txt
   - python manage.py check               # Run checks to ensure the application is working fine

test:
  stage: test
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env
   - source env/bin/activate
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   - python manage.py test taskManager

oast-frontend:
  stage: test
  image: node:alpine3.10
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm install -g retire@5.0.0 # Install retirejs npm package.
    - retire --outputformat json --outputpath retirejs-report.json --severity high
  artifacts:
    paths: [retirejs-report.json]
    when: always # What is this for?
    expire_in: one week
  allow_failure: true

integration:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - echo "This is an integration step"
    - exit 1
  allow_failure: true # Even if the job fails, continue to the next stages

prod:
  stage: prod
  script:
    - echo "This is a deploy step."
  when: manual # Continuous Delivery
```


Go ahead and add it to the .gitlab-ci.yml file to run the pipeline.

You will notice that the oast-frontend job has failed but didnâ€™t block the other jobs from running.

As discussed, any change to the repo kick starts the pipeline.

We can see the results of this pipeline by visiting https://gitlab-ce-XqiHnDZ0.lab.practical-devsecops.training/root/django-nv/pipelines.
