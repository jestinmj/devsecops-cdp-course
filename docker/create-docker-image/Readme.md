Docker Image
================================

We will learn how to create docker image
------------------------------------------------

In this scenario, you will learn how to build a container image using Docker.

Download the source code
------------------------------------------------

We will do all the exercises locally first in DevSecOps-Box, so letâ€™s start the exercise.

First, We need to download the source code of the project from our git repository.

```
git clone https://gitlab.practical-devsecops.training/pdso/django.nv
cd django.nv
```

Build the image
----------------

To build a docker image, we need a file called Dockerfile that contains instructions to build the image.

```
cat Dockerfile
---
# FROM python base image
FROM python:2-alpine

# COPY startup script
COPY . /app

WORKDIR /app

RUN apk add --no-cache gawk sed bash grep bc coreutils
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
RUN chmod +x reset_db.sh && bash reset_db.sh

# EXPOSE port 8000 for communication to/from server
EXPOSE 8000

# CMD specifcies the command to execute container starts running.
CMD ["/app/run_app_docker.sh"]
```

Next, we can create the image using the following command.

```
docker build -t django.nv:1.0 .
```
The purpose of this command is to build a Docker image from a Dockerfile located in the current directory (.) and tag it as django.nv:1.0.

Here's a breakdown:
docker build: This is the Docker command to build a Docker image.
-t: This option specifies the name and tag of the image. In this case, django.nv is the name and 1.0 is the tag.
.": This dot (.`) refers to the current directory, which contains the Dockerfile that the command will use to build the image.

After the build finishes, we can see the image using the following command.

```
docker images
```

As you can see above on line number 2, there is a django.nv image with TAG as 1.0.

Exercise: Create a docker image
----------------

1. Rename the docker image django.nv:1.0 to django.nv:1.1
2. Override Entrypoint to run a bash shell (/bin/bash)
    Delete the docker image django.nv:1.0

> Hint
>
> We can override entrypoint in two ways. One by overriding entrypoint. Try to run this command docker run --help then have a look at the option for entrypoint. Second, you can edit the Dockerfile and override ENTRYPOINT.
